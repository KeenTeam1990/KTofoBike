# Setup
1. Add ```pod 'MIBlurPopup'``` to your Podfile or copy the "MIBlurPopup.swift" into your project
2. Make sure the view controller you want to present conforms the protocol ```MIBlurPopupDelegate```
3. Present the view controller with: ```MIBlurPopup.show(popupViewController, on: <some view controller>)``` or just set ```MIBlurPopupSegue``` as your custom segue's class like that

**NB:** If you have added MIBlurPopup through pod, you also have to set the Module as "MIBlurPopup".

# Customization
You can customize the popup behavior with the MIBlurPopupDelegate protocol
- ```popupView: UIView // the view that contains the popup```
- ```blurEffectStyle: UIBlurEffectStyle // the blur effect style you want to apply to the background```
- ```initialScaleAmmount: CGFloat // âˆˆ(0, 1), this property will be used to calculate size that the popupView will have at the begin of the presentation and at the end of the dismiss. When != 1 it will induce a zoom-effect.```
- ```animationDuration: TimeInterval // the transitions animations duration```

#TODO
* [x] Add a todo list
* [x] Add storyboard support (eg: with custom segue)
