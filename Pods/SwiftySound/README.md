## Overview
Swifty Sound is a simple library that lets you deal with Swift sounds easily.

##### Static methods

```swift
Sound.play(file: "dog.wav")
```

```swift
Sound.play(url: fileURL)
```

More advanced example:

```swift
Sound.play(file: "dog", fileExtension: "wav", numberOfLoops: 2)
```
The above will play the sound three times.

Specify a negative number of loops to play the sound continously in an intinite loop:

```swift
Sound.play(file: "dog", fileExtension: "wav", numberOfLoops: -1)
```

Stop currently playing sounds:

```swift
Sound.stopAll()
```

Enable/disable all sounds:

```swift
Sound.enabled = true
Sound.enabled = false
```

The value of `Sound.enabled` property will be automatically persisted in `UserDefaults` and restored on the next launch of your app.

Change sound categories. SwiftySound provides a simple way of changing sound category:

```swift
Sound.category = .ambient
```
This changes the category of the underlying shared `AVAudioSession` instance. The default value is `SoundCategory.ambient`. Due to `AVAudioSession` architecture, this property is not available on macOS.

##### Creating instances of `Sound` class

You can also create an instance of a Sound class and store it somewhere in your app.
```swift
let sound = Sound(url: fileURL)
sound.play()
```

## Installation
### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. See the [Get Started](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) section for more details.

#### Podfile
```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
pod 'SwiftySound'
```
### Installation with Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a lightweight dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C. It leverages CocoaTouch modules and is less invasive than CocoaPods.

To install with carthage, follow the instruction on [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

#### Cartfile
```
github "adamcichy/SwiftySound"
```

### Installation with Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Just add the url of this repo to your `Package.swift` file as a dependency:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourPackage",
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/adamcichy/SwiftySound.git",
                 majorVersion: 0)
    ]
)
```

Then run `swift build` and wait for SPM to install SwiftySound.

### Manual installation
Drop the `Sound.swift` file into your project, link against `AVFoundation.framework` and you are ready to go.
